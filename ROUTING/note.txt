Routing
-------

-It is nothing but the dynamic way to fetch some content from a location
- Generally it does three thing
    >> it goes to a location
    >> Gets a new content
    >> it injects into current (page's HTML/DOM)

- it is mainly used it Single Page Application SPAs
    - it goes to various part of logical division of app means navbar,sidebar,body
    - It is loading views individually/independently.
**Note: Routing: Available at server/Client

How do we implepent
-------------------
- Client-Side Routing
  -------------------
    - we can achieve Client side Routing in several ways
        >>ngRoute
        >>UI-Route 
        >>etc.
- Steps (For ngRoute):
  --------------------
    > Include ngRoute module
        >> angular-route.js (it always made available afterangular.js)
    > Use ngRoute as module dependency
        Example: 
            var app = angular.module('app',['ngRoute']);
    > Use $routeProvider to configure routes
        >> Routing URLS(location)
        >> Views (content)
        >> Controller to be associated with Views
        >> etc.
        Example:
            app.config(['$routeProvider',function($routeProvider){
                $routeProvider.when('/first_msg',{
                    templateUrl: 'msg1.htmll',
                    Controller: 'message1'
                })
            }])
    > Declare "ng-view"to hold or inject content or view
        Example:
            <div ng-view></div>

$route service
--------------
- $route is responsible for cached reload/refresh, list of all routes, reload current route with new params value
  keep track of routes requests and access $scope object of current route.

- It has two properties
    1. current
        >> params
        >> scope
        >> etc
    2. routes
- it has couple of methods of $route
    1. reload
    2. updateParams
- and events also.
    1. $routeChangeStart
    2. $routeChangeSuccess
    3. $routeChangeError
    4. $routeUpdate

Routing & Resolve
-----------------
In General way of Routing:
    Redirect To new Route
            |
            |$locationChangeStart
            |$routeChangeStart
    change Url
            |
            |$locationChangeSuccess
    jump/load route
            |
            |$routeChangeSuccess
    Execute Controller/associate Scope
            |
            |
        Do AJAX operations<----Take the data from the WebService 
        |
        |_Bind AJAX results to View through scope

- In  the General way of Routing we are getting the after the routeChangeSuccess and when controller is ready

In Resolve way of Routing:
    Redirect To new Route
            |
            |$locationChangeStart
            |$routeChangeStart
    change Url
            |
            |$locationChangeSuccess
      Execute 'Resolve'-->------------------------->-------------|
            |                                                    |
            |                                                    |
     Do AJAX Operation<----Take the data from the WebService     |
            |                                                    |Resolved Result from WebService through Resolve
            |                                                    |
    jump/load route                                              |
            |                                                    |
            |$routeChangeSuccess                                 |
    Execute Controller/associate Scope<----------<---------------|
            |
            |
Bind Resolved results to View through scope

- But here after the change url when $locationChangeSuccess is ready then it executes Resolves and do ajax operations after that and the ng-module is maintaining the Resolved Result data which is fetched by the AJAX operation till controller being updated.

conclusion will be:
without Resolving
    -jump to the route first
    - get the data later
with Resolving
    - get Data first
    - Then jump to route and pass data

when you are running day3/test/test3.html before run day2-v2/expressAJAX/ then run npm start which will start localhost:8000
