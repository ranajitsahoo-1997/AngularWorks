Angular JS Services
-------------------

- Service is a special unit of Code which can used across different controller.
We can think like service is nothing but a business logic or utilies code or webservices.
- we should not write our business code in our controllers, controllers only used to provide data to views and viceversa.
- So service helps us to write business code or any utilities code inside it and then we can use that service more than one controllers.

- Service is a singleton i.e. only one instance of the service can be created and the same instance is used to serve through out the AngularJS application.
So Services are static in nature and Controllers are dynamic.

- Services are loaded and initialized lazily
i.e. services are not initialized when the angular js application started but the controllers are started.
Services is initialized only when a controller refer to the respective service if it is not instanciated before, otherwise controller will use the same refernce object of the service.

- we can have multiple services for one module and can be used by multiple controllers.

-Services can interact with each other. i.e service-1 can share its code to 
service-2 and viceversa. share means we can call a service in another service.

Types of services
-----------------
1. Built-in Services
    - It is a part of Angular framework.
    -Ex: $http, $log, $location etc.

2. Custom Services
    - It is developed by us.
    - It Clould be extensions to Built-in services
    - It Could be business logic service.

Business Services
-----------------
- It is nothing but a Custom services.

                                                                                                             |---------controllerN<--model Data------------>View-N

Developing Custom services
--------------------------
Services can be created in three ways as follows:

1. Factory
-----------
    Example:-
        var app = angular.module("app", [])
        app.controller("emp",["$scope", function($scope, calcFactory){
            ...
            calcFactory.doSum(); // in Controller calcFactory object is using doSum()
            ...
        }]);
        app.factory('calcFactory',[function(){
            var oCalcService = {}; //create service(js) object
            oCalcService.doSum = function(){ object is including doSum function
                ...
            };
            return oCalcService; // Return the object
        }])


2. Service
----------
    Example:-
        var app = angular.module("app", [])
        app.controller("emp",["$scope", function($scope, calcService){
            ...
            calcService.doSum(); // in Controller calcservice object is using doSum()
            ...
        }]);
        app.service('calcService',[function(){
            this.doSum = function()
                            { object is including doSum function
                                ...
                            };
            
        }])
        ** service object is instantiated automatically by angular js

3. Provider
-----------
    Example:-
        var app = angular.module("app", [])
        app.controller("emp",["$scope", function($scope, calcService){
            ...
            calcService.doSum(); // in Controller calcservice object is using doSum()
            ...
        }]);
        
        app.provider('calService', function(){
            
            var baseUrl = '';
            this.config = function(url){
                baseUrl = url;
            }
            this.$get = function(){
                var oCalcService = {}
                oCalcService.doSum = function(){..};
                return oCalcService;
            };

        });

        app.config(["calcServiceProvider",function(calcServiceProvider){
            calcServiceProvider.config('http://localhost:3001')
        }]);
        **Note- This configuration registered before the controller and services.
