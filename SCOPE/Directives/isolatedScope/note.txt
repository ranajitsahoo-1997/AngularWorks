Isolated Scope
--------------
- Directives which creates their own scope completely separated from parent scope is called Isolated Scope.
- While decalring directives if scope attribute is false is called shared scope, if it is true then it has its own scope but inherited but if scope has assigned to {} empty object it is called isolated scope.
- No inheritance or relation from parent scope.
- Modifications to isolated scope will have no affect on parent scope and viceversa.
- with scope parameter we can communicate to any of the parent scope.
