$apply and $digest
----------------------------------
> Both services are used to trigger digest process manually
> Mainly used when the scope variables are modified out of "Angular COntext"
  and /or UI needs to be refresh its data-bindings.
> Behind the scenes,$apply calls $digest
> Usage; $scope.$apply, $scope.$digest

$apply
------
- The Digest process always starts with "$rootscope"
- After evaluating RootScope, the process continues through all child scopes and nested scopes one after another.
- Behind the scenes ng-click,$timeout,$http(ajax) etc. operations are calling $apply.

$digest
--------
- It always trigger the current scope and its child/nested scopes only.
- It doesnot starts with the root scope or parentscope
- it could be called from rootscope also equivalent to $apply
