UI-ROUTER
----------

What is routing?
- it actually does three things in genral
    - it goes to a location (hashed URL)
    - Get new Content (View/HTML)
    - Injects into current (page's) HTML/DOM
- It is mainly used for SPAs (Single Page Application)
    - it has various parts of views like header sidebar and body etc
    - loading views individually/ independently
NOTE** Routing is available at server/clinet

What is UI-routing?
-------------------
- Client-Side Routing
    There are several ways to achieve this 
        - ngRoute
        - UI-Router etc.
- UI-Router
    It is built by Angular UI team
    - It fully replaces ngRoute and more powerful than ng-Router
    - It developed around the concept of 'states'
      as opposed to routes
    states(in ui-router)
    ------
    - A bit more than routes
    - More comprehensive navigation criteria
    - Holds routes and their behaviors
    - it describe how UI would look like
        when a navigation occurs
        Or when a route is triggered
        Or when we switch to different route/state
    - It will be identified by its own (unique) name
        possible to navigate through name (instead of route)
    - Configured using $stateProvider

    -Top Advantages:
    > Multiple views
        >> side-by-side(sibling)
        >> nested
    - Nested States
    - Availabilities of Controller/Scope between nested states/views.
Working with ui-router
----------------------
- Steps for ui-router
    > include ui-router module
        >> angular-ui-router.js after angular.js
    > use 'ui-router' as module dependency
        var app = angular.module('app',['ui-router']);
    > Use $stateProvider to configure states (and routes)
        - States
        - Routing URLS (location)
        - Views (content)
        - Controller to be associated with views
        - Nested states/Viewsetc.
        Example:
            app.config(['$stateProvider',function($stateProvider){
                $stateProvider   |------------------------name of the State
                .state('FirstMessage',{
                    url: '/first-message',
                    templateURL: 'msg1.html',
                    controller: 'msg1'
                })
            }])
- Declare "ui-view" to hold (or inject) content
    it can have multiple instance
    and even nested

How to send UI-Router Parameters
- Using Routing URL and "ui-sref"
- Using "ui-sref" (but not available through URL)
- Using Query Parameters

UI-Router Parameters: features Supported
- Optional Parameters
- Default values
- Regular Expression Support (regex)
- 'ui-sref' Support
- Array support
- Squashing
    - How to represent default values in URL,when they are same as the current value.

What is $stateParams
- $stateParams
    - It comes with ui-router module
    - Easiest waaay to access current ui-router parameter values
    - Used mainly incontroller/scope/service related Code
    - Needs to be injected
